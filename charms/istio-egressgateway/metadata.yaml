  Istio is an open platform-independent service mesh that provides
  traffic management, policy enforcement, and telemetry collection.

  Open: Istio is being developed and maintained as open-source software.
  We encourage contributions and feedback from the community at-large.

  Platform-independent: Istio is not targeted at any specific deployment
  environment. During the initial stages of development, Istio will
  support Kubernetes-based deployments. However, Istio is being built
  to enable rapid and easy adaptation to other environments.

  Service mesh: Istio is designed to manage communications between
  microservices and applications. Without requiring changes to the
  underlying services, Istio provides automated baseline traffic
  resilience, service metrics collection, distributed tracing, traffic
  encryption, protocol upgrades, and advanced routing functionality for
  all service-to-service communication.
